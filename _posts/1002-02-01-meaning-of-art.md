Excellent art offers something to mankind that everyday life
cannot. In the words of Vladimir Solovyev, “Art does not produce
the exact objects and phenomena of reality, but only what the
artist sees in them, and the true artist sees only what is
typical and characteristic; the aesthetic element of natural
phenomena, passing through the mind and imagination of the
artist, is purged of all that is material and casual” (Solovyev
et al. 50).

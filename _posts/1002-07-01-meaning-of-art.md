Robert Gwathmey says in his article “Art for Art’s
    Sake” that Francisco Goya’s “The Disasters of War” portrayed war
    far too meaningfully, Giotto di Bondone displayed too abundant a
    skill in his “The Last Judgement,” and Lorenzetti contrasted
    government types in his three frescos much too well for their
    moral, religious, and political artworks to be reduced simply to
    “beauty.”

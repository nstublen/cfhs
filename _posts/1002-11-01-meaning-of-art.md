“Art for art’s sake” is an insult to
    art and the artist. George Sand once said, “Talent imposes
    duties. Art for art's sake is a vain word. Art for the truth, art
    for the good, art for the beautiful, that is the religion that I
    seek” (Ferrero 276). While the age of aestheticism introduced
    many new and beneficial ideas to the field of art and still
    affects society in amazing ways today, Sand held that it’s
    fundamental belief of “Art for art’s sake” hindered the
    progression of art significantly.

The phrase, “art for art’s sake,” first appeared in a work of William Makepeace Thackeray’s in the year 1839 (Spingarn 263). Its meaning, essentially, is that one might seek beauty and aesthetic above all else, with no higher priority; an artist creates art simply so that art may exist. In the words of Théophile Gautier, “Art for Art's sake means, for its adepts—the pursuit of pure beauty without any other preoccupation” (Ferrero 276).

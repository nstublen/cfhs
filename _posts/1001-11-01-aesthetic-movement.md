    she would be none of these things though you were to
    bray her in a mortar. All the battering in the world will never
    hammer her into fitness for such an office as thatâ€¦ Her business
    is not to do good on other grounds, but to be good on her own:
    all is well with her while she sticks fast to that (Bristow).

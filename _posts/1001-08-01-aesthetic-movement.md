Several things contributed to the transition from the Victorian era to the age of aestheticism. The late eighteenth century writings of Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Judgement were a great influence, as he held that moral reasoning should be considered separately from oneâ€™s aesthetic judgements and that art itself is its own end (Bristow). In addition to this, the Aesthetic movement was a harsh reaction to the Victorian period started before it.

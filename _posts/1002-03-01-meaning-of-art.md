The creation of art itself, limited in its occupation
of space and time, is a continuation of the art that can be found
in the world man lives in, and the beauty that art adds to life
lightens and subdues the darkness found in the material world,
enabling the achievement of any good (Solovyev et al. 52).
Artistic pursuits have the inherent ability to intensify,
clarify, and interpret oneâ€™s emotions and passions.

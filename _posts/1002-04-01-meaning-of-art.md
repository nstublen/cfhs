Practically speaking, art is entirely pointless, and its pursuit is in vain;
however, mankind does not live on earth for a practical

through food and drink, fame and wealth, promiscuity and pleasure
show a yearning to escape from the world, but, alternatively, a
pursuit of art is truly an escape to the world.
